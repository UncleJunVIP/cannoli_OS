# Why?

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

I built the [Game Manager](https://github.com/UncleJunVIP/nextui-game-manager) Pak
for [NextUI](https://nextui.loveretro.games) and thought isn't this essentially a launch launcher?

Taking what I've learned from building Paks, I wanted to try building a no-frills launcher backed by RetroArch.
